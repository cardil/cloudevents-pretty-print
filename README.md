## 🚴 Usage

TBD

### 🛠️ Build

Make sure you have `cargo-make` installed. You can install it by running:

```asciidoc
cargo install --force cargo-make
```

then call simply:

```
cargo make
```

### 🔬 Test

```
cargo make test
```

### 🎁 Publish OCI registry

```
cargo make publish
```

**NOTE**: You need to be authorized to push the image to the registry 
(proper access should be set in `~/.docker/config.json` file). By default, 
the registry is set to `quay.io` and the image name to 
`cardil/cloudevents-pretty-print`. You can change it by setting `REGISTRY` 
and `IMAGE_NAME` environment variables.
